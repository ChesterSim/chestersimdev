        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I didn’t start out as a programming geek, deep-diving into the binary world with excitement at a young age.
        In fact, I almost didn’t choose Computer Science for my college studies. When I first applied for NUS,
        I was accepted for my first choice Business. It was only towards the end of my National Service, that I decided to take a leap of faith.
        You could say that I was one of those jumping on the CS bandwagon, but to be fair, I had chose Business
        because I didn’t know what I wanted to do in the future. It also became clear to me then, that what
        I should study in school should be more technical, rather than the practicality of Business studies. </p>

        <p>My first year of studies was still rather smooth, with me balancing school and hall life.
        I chose to stay in hall, specifically Raffles Hall, to experience as much of the Uni life as possible,
        and my only regret was not joining any NUS CCA. Study-wise, I felt that even though I had decent grades,
        I still could have performed better. More importantly, I didn’t regret taking that leap of faith. I thoroughly
        enjoyed myself solving programming problems; Math being my favourite subject since young definitely
        helped with the problem-solving and technicality!</p>

        <p>Outside of programming, I love to play sports, travel, eat, and read up on new technologies!
        I am a huge Manchester United fan, and would play soccer regularly. I would also take on and play new sports
        all the time with my friends, and Raffles Hall has enabled me to do just that. Combining travelling and eating,
        I love going overseas, exploring new places, and try local delights! On new technologies, I’m one of those
        who people will call Apple sheep. I do love the Apple ecosystem, and how seamless everything works together.
        Of course, I do appreciate other similar products from competitors and also see the falling standards of Apple,
        but my faith won’t going anywhere in the foreseeable future. Love to talk about tech too? Hit me up!</p>

        <p>My favourite short story is by Manoj Bhargava:
        “A blind man is walking towards a well, and there’s a guy watching. If the blind man falls into the well,
        who gets the blame? The blind man or the guy who is watching?”</p>
        <p>I believe that we should always try and help those around us, even if it is a minute task, and maybe one day that favour will be returned to us &#128513;</p>
